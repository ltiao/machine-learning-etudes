   An *étude* (a French word meaning *study*) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill.

Inspired by Peter Norvig's pytudes_, which was in turn inspired by the book 
"Etudes for Programmers (1978)" by Charles Wetherell.
